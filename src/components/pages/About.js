			<img className="profilePic" src="./prof-pic.jpg" alt="Cody Gallagher" />
			<p>
				Born and raised in Colorado and spun around the sun 30 times, I've
				found passion in fantasy and all that it creates. I have a degree in
				graphic design and computer graphics from the University of Northern
				Colorado.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				I Currently work for PramsPlus as a support specialist for many oil
				and gas companies that use our production program. With lots of
				patience I hope to learn a skill I have never fully been able to
				grasp, coding. With this knowledge I hope to be able to improve
				myself in my job and one day launch Prams via the web.
			</p>
			<br />

				I enjoy a game of magic whenever I can get it and in my spare time
				I've picked up tabletop war-gaming. I like to paint models and find
				it very satisfying to see all the work that slowly progresses on
				them. I have two cats Dex and Bow who are way too cute! I live with
				my fiancee and we enjoy eating sushi.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				Thank you for taking the time to read about me. I hope you enjoy
				looking at my work and projects soon to come!
